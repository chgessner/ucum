Please provide the following a literature reference (or attachment) which provides a scientific definition. A scientific definition is a quantitative one, not just words "unit for the amount of XYZ." A scientific definition will also give some way of converting or inferencing something with the values expressed using that unit. You can include document URLs or drag/drop attachments to accompany your request.

Note the scope of UCUM is science, healthcare, engineering, and business (not including currencies). Units outside this context are discouraged.

Be certain to include the unit in the issue title above.
