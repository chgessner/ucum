## Conformance

You may declare conformance to these UCUM functional tests if your
implementation accepts the attached xml file as an input, and passes all
the test cases below. You should always quote the most recent date from
the history entries below when claiming conformance. You may qualify the
conformance to particular kinds of cases if your functionality does not
cover all the tests. Note that conformance to these tests does not
equate to conformance to UCUM itself - though one could reasonably claim
to be compliant with UCUM if one is conformant to these tests.
