# Organization and Procedures Project

The goal of this project is to define the governance and maintenance
structure of UCUM.

UCUM follows mostly the approach that LOINC has taken.

However, unlike LOINC the maintenance activity is less in numbers and
requires more in depth discussions.

Therefore the current structure being piloted is to recruit a
\[BoardOfAdvisors Board of Advisors (the Board)\] that formulates
guidelines and decisions on detail.

We now have active conversation with the FDA and EMA over their IDMP
project. This is nudging us to formalize our Organization and
Procedures. We are creating a brief \[CharterAndBylaws Charter/Bylaws
statement\] which will appear here shortly.
