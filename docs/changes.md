title: Proposing changes to documentation
post_excerpt: UCUM's documentation exists in a wiki-like state where change proposals are encouraged.
---

UCUM documentation is meant to be responsive, accepting appropriate changes and additions from the community. UCUM's maintainers will always update these documents in response to updates in the specification but users can be more keenly aware of their usage. Behaving similar to a wiki, we appreciate your pull requests to inform us of corrections or meaningful additions.

## Proposing changes using GitHub

The complete instructions are forthcoming. The process has been modeled after [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/propose-a-content-change-using-github/).
