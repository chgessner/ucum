# The UCUM Organization Charter and Bylaws

## Mission

To publish, maintain and promote the Unified Code for Units of Measure.

## Stakeholder and Contributor Roles

The UCUM Organization is a volunteer organization that recognizes
contributors based on their contribution to the mission of the
Organization. The following roles are recognized:

1.  "The Public:" observers, users, or anyone with interest in UCUM.
2.  '''Registered User of the Web Site:''' the UCUM work is centered
    around its web site unitsofmeasure.org. The published material is
    open for the public to view and download, etc. But in order to
    engage with proposals and discussions one must register as a user.
    To register, go to the web site and search the word Register on the
    top menu or directly go to the URL
    <http://unitsofmeasure.org/trac/register>. Registered users may view
    and submit change requests, other suggestions or questions as
    tickets. The chief process of interacting with the UCUM organization
    is through tickets.
3.  '''Verified Contributor:''' someone who has contributed meaningfully
    with a proposal or thoughtful question (usually by submitting a
    relevant ticket) should be promoted to become a verified user.
    Promotion to verified user status ''should'' be performed manually
    by a user with administrator privileges.
4.  '''\[BoardOfAdvisors Board of Advisors\]:''' the decision making
    body of the UCUM Organization is the Board of Advisors (or in short
    "the Board"). The Board of Advisors may elect other members to the
    Board (or remove from the board) by a simple majority. The duties of
    a member of the Board of Advisors are to engage in the decision
    making process of the UCUM Organization. Decisions may be technical
    or organizational in nature. To be eligible to become a member of
    the Board of Advisor, an individual must:
      - have expertise in a relevant subject matter of units of measures
      - must understand the technical subject matter to be able to
          - adjudicate changes and
          - explain the technical reasoning behind changes.
      - must have been and continue to be supportive of UCUM, and
          - must promote and not undermine UCUM when being involved of
            competing activity A member of the Board of Advisors should
            be actively contributing commensurable to the actual
            activity of the UCUM Organization.
5.  '''Administrator:''' a user may have administrator privileges which
    allow them to manage the web site content or assign privileges to
    other members.
6.  '''Chairman of the Board:''' the Board of Advisors elects a Chairman
    of the Board.
7.  '''Ex Officio and Honorary Board Member:''' the Board has
      - one ex-officio member who is a member of the Regenstrief
        Institute, Inc., which is the Copyright holder of UCUM along
        with the UCUM Organization.
      - the Founders, Gunther Schadow and Clem McDonald, are honorary
        members of the Board until their resignation.
8.  '''Secretary:''' volunteers or employees of organizational
    volunteers who offer clerical and organizational management services
    to the UCUM organization are recognized as secretaries. A secretary
    may be given administrator privileges on the web site. Secretary is
    a title recognized and granted by the Board of Advisors, who may
    elect and remove secretaries. A secretary is not automatically an
    ex-officio member of the Board of Advisors and the role of Secretary
    confers no voting privileges.
9.  '''Editor:''' are registered users with write access to the UCUM
    specification repository and the ability to apply changes to the
    UCUM specification and the publishing of updated versions. Editors
    are added or removed by the Board of Advisors and must be board
    members or secretaries.

## Decision Making

It is in the nature of the field of Units of Measure that it is very
stable and maintenance activity may be very low. For this reason, the
UCUM Organization is constituted as a light-weight organization. The
central interaction device for all decision making is an active
management web site, <http://unitsofmeasure.org>. Face to face or
telephone meetings are held minimally. There are no standing meetings.

All decisions are made by the Board of Advisors by simple majority.

### Organizational Decisions

Organizational Decisions are decisions which alter the structure or
bylaws of the organization or grant roles such as secretaries and
editors, must be made with at least the chairman of the Board, one
ex-officio member present and two other board members voting (not
abstaining) in a real time discussion via telephone or per discussion
convened electronically on the web site. All members of the Board of
Advisors must be notified with motions to change bylaws or organization
submitted in writing on the web site at least 30 days prior to the
voting.

The process for decisions of the Board is as follows:

1.  A Board member moves by submitting a ticket of type "board motion"
      - selecting the component "organization" for the ticket if it is
        an organizational motion.
          - If it is a technical motion, see below for '''Technical
            Decisions'''.
      - Only Board members can submit board motions.
      - The chairman may move.
2.  Once placed the motion is open for discussion by Board Members
    submitting ticket comments.
      - Any Board member who accepts or starts commenting other than
        rejecting the motion outright does the equivalent of "seconding
        the motion"
      - There is no need of uttering the word "second".
      - The chairman may second, no need to wait for someone else to
        second.
3.  When discussion reaches its end the chairman calls the question
      - "call the question\!" is not a means of ending a protracted
        discussion.
4.  To vote, board members comment "yay" or "nay" or "abstain"
      - The default voting period is one week.
      - Voting may be expedited to end one day after 2/3 of board
        members have voted.
      - All Board members are expected to vote of Board motions.
      - The chairman may vote.
5.  The chairman counts the votes and declares the motion for passed or
    failed.
      - To pass, the number of "yay"s must be greater than the number of
        "nay"s.

### Technical Decisions

Technical Decisions are made on tickets by at least two (2) board
members documenting assent to the proposal. When only one board member
engages in the adjudication and no other board member weighs in in
opposition, the decision of the single board member may be implemented.
However, decisions by a single board member cannot bind the UCUM
Organization to implement this decision if the single board member so
deciding does not himself implement the decision.

All technical decisions are made on a ticket which may be submitted by
any user of the UCUM web site (even non-verified new users). A ticket
must be accepted by a board member to be turned into action. Any
verified user can comment on tickets by commenting on the ticket. Board
members can decide on the ticket status.

The process of action on a technical ticket is as follows:

1.  A board member or secretary reviews the request and triages it.
      - Possibly revising the category.
      - Drafting a quick excerpt of the essence of the request and
        proposes one of the determinations:
2.  Accept, in which case the Board member or secretary will be the
    owner and make a concrete change proposal to the specification.
      - A ticket cannot be accepted without a concrete change proposal
        to the specification.
      - Other board members ''should'' review and opine to the change.
      - If the proposal was accepted by a secretary, at least one board
        member must approve the proposal.
3.  Reject, in which case the Board member or secretary will give a
    rationale to the proposal to reject.
      - The status of such tickets are "reject\_proposed".
      - At least one other board member needs to agree with the
        rejection proposal, in which case the next status will be
        "wontfix" (will not change).
      - The registered user who submitted the ticket may provide further
        comment and justification, thus disputing the rejection
        decision.
      - If the rejection decision is disputed, another board member may
        adopt the ticket and take it to Reconsider status, but such
        board member must then accept the responsibility of seeing the
        change request through.
          - A proposal for reconsideration must be actionable, it must
            explain how the issue can be resolved, how the concerns of
            the rejecting board member can be addressed, the emphasis is
            ''how'' not just ''why''.
4.  Other statuses may exist to determine that the request is not
    actionable or doesn't identify a specific change need, is out of
    scope or suggests a problem that is not a real problem. These
    determinations can be made by one board member or secretary.

The web site can be used to create ticket reports. The "timeline"
function of the web site, and most ticket information can only be seen
by registered users; this is necessary and highly effective to prevent
ticket spam, i.e., by removing the pay-off for a spammer to place spam
tickets: links they place in their spam tickets will not end up on
search engines.

## Specification

The UCUM specification's source code is maintained in a Subversion (SVN)
repository. Write access to the Subversion repository is granted to
editors who can apply changes to the specification and produce a new
release.
