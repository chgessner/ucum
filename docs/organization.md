post_excerpt: Defining the governance and maintenance structure of UCUM.
---

The goal of this project is to define the governance and maintenance structure of UCUM.

UCUM follows mostly the approach that LOINC has taken.

However, unlike LOINC the maintenance activity is less in numbers and requires more in depth discussions.

Therefore the current structure being piloted is to recruit Advisors that formulates guidelines and decisions on detail.

We now have active conversation with the FDA and EMA over their IDMP project. This is nudging us to formalize our Organization and Procedures.
